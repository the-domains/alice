description: >-
  Shindo® is a Japanese word and means, “The Guidance of the Heart/Soul” or “The
  Way of the Heart”. It means that in order to relax we would  have to take an
  inner journey towards the present moment, towards our true being. It also
  means that the way we work in Shindo® is respectful, warm and gentle. Shindo®
  is a tool for greater relaxation and balance in our life.


  The main practice in Shindo® classes are six powerful easy-to-learn stretches
  that are supported by pressure techniques and warm presence of the other
  person, usually Shindo instructor. They affect the body on all levels,
  relieving stress from all levels of our being, generating energy for everyday
  life. The stretches combine breathing, movement and natural concentration into
  balanced unity.


  Shindo® bodywork is based on the theory of meridians in Chinese medicine,
  (also other Asian traditions consider the meridians to be of importance in
  maintaining a healthy system). Meridians are the pathways of ‘ki’ energy flow
  found in a living body. According to the theory stress and excessive emotions
  cause imbalances and blockages to meridians causing sickness and dysfunctions
  to organs.


  Shindo® helps to open up and balance the meridians and thus balance the whole
  system. Keeping on stretching exercise everyday or at least once a week it
  works to improve the flow of ‘ki’ energy in the body and it has a beneficial
  effect on preventing illness as well as balancing our mind.
