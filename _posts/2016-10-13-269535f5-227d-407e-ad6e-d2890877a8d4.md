  Who among us did not want to be a “Little Witch” or a Wizard having a magic
  wand or being able to cure someone with just a flick of a finger?!


  I wanted to be – really wanted to be!


  When I was a little girl it was always me, who tried to take away my mothers
  headache with my little fingers or I was walking on my fathers back, so he
  could straighten it and being able to walk normally again.


  As far as I can remember myself, I’ve always wanted to „help“ others and be
  kind to them. Once I even wanted to become a police officer – thanks to my dad
  – thinking that this would be the way to change the world! But Universe had
  different plans with me! And truly – I’m really happy, it did! 


  Somewhere in a year 2001, when i have been practicing for several years
  martial arts in USA, i got an inspiring thought – What if i would learn how to
  heal others?! 


  Eastern philosophy is really amazing: if you know how to hurt one, then you
  should know how to heal one! Cool! If student is ready, there appears a
  teacher! 


  One great massage therapist, Ingrid, wanted to pass on her knowledge of what
  she knows, and she chose me to be her student. How did i get to be sooooo
  lucky! I love and adore her very much!


  In a year 2002 I returned to Estonia and started studyng massage under Ingid’s
  guidens. If you don’t know it yet, then this is deeper massage, where i’m
  finding the blockages and ackes in your body and massaging them deepely. My
  body loves it, so I am giving it to you as well… 


  While i like energies, energetic and spiritual stuff, I had an
  Auratransformation™ in march 2011. This is the time, where my life started to
  change a lot! In the same time, i got introduced to a Tantra world. I have
  participated in some tantra courses. This is a world of it’s own, which idea
  is to combine the body and spirit of ours, so that we would function in joy
  with loving our bodies.


  In one energetic camp I got introduced to Shindo®stretching – a Japanese
  stretching and massage method. I got really impressed by that, that I needed
  to know more about it. So I did learn Shindo® stretching and massage.


  Year 2012 has been really interesting year! Among learning Quantum
  Entrainment®, Shiki I also stumbled across something really weird and wacky
  thing called Access Consciousness®. It gave me totally different view to the
  world, which is really cool!


  In a year 2013 my life brought me to Belgium where I have done some charity
  work. In 2015 it was an honor to be a vice-president for NATO Charity Bazaar.
  Time full of exciting experiences,  a lot of new friends and help to thous who
  are in need.


  I wonder, where do my adventures take me next? Well that I will know when the
  time arrives!


  So far, you can come and let me heal your body with the massage I adore!


  With Joy & Gratitude!
