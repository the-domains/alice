  While many massages are designed to provide pleasure and relaxation to the
  client, there are some massages that focus on providing superior health
  benefits. In Healing Massage there will be focus on the deeper layers of
  muscle tissue, trigger points and our main meridians.


  It is especially helpful for chronically tense and contracted areas such as
  stiff necks, low back tightness, and sore shoulders.


  Using deep muscle compression and friction along the grain of the muscle,
  trigger points and meridians helps to loosen muscle tissues, release toxins
  from muscles and get blood and oxygen circulating properly. It is both
  corrective and therapeutic. It is beneficial for many physical problems,
  including sports injuries and chronic pain. Because it works very deeply,
  emotional issues can also be addressed, when these have been stored in the
  body.


  Treatments take place on a massage table on bare skin. Healing Massage will
  focus on whole body with deeper touch and may cause some soreness during or
  after the session. But you should feel better within a day or two. Water helps
  to eliminate toxins from the body so it is important to drink plenty of water
  after a Healing Massage to help this process along.
